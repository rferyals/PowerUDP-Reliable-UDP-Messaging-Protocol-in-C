# PowerUDP-Reliable-UDP-Messaging-Protocol-in-C
â€“ C (BSD Sockets)
Implemented a custom client-server communication system with reliable UDP messaging. Designed a layered protocol supporting message acknowledgment, retransmission with exponential backoff, and optional sequencing. Integrated dynamic runtime configuration using multicast, socket signal handling, and packet loss simulation. Developed both TCP and UDP communication flows and validated the system under adverse network conditions.
